# AI-Enhanced Screen Capture Tool - Master Plan

## App Overview
A desktop application that enhances the traditional screen capture experience by integrating AI capabilities. Users can capture screen areas and immediately interact with the captured content using multimodal LLMs, with the chat interface appearing alongside the capture area for seamless interaction.

### Objectives
- Streamline the workflow of analyzing screen content with AI
- Provide an intuitive, non-intrusive user interface
- Maintain user focus by keeping interaction contexts together
- Offer essential image manipulation features without overwhelming complexity

## Target Audience
- Knowledge workers who frequently need AI insights about visual content
- Researchers analyzing visual information
- Users who regularly interact with multimodal LLMs
- Professionals who want to streamline their workflow

## Core Features

### Screen Capture
- Area selection with screen dimming overlay
- Single-click window capture
- Basic image manipulation tools:
  * Crop adjustment
  * Highlight tool

### AI Integration
- Initial support for OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API
- Extensible architecture for future LLM integrations
- User-configurable API keys
- Real-time chat interface

### User Interface
- System tray icon with quick access menu
- Floating chat window
  * Draggable positioning
  * Minimize/close controls
  * Image preview
  * Chat interface
- Settings window accessible from system tray

### History Management
- Local storage of recent interactions (default: 15 sessions)
- FIFO automatic cleanup
- Manual history clearing option
- Session storage includes:
  * Timestamp
  * Captured image
  * Chat history
  * Capture location

### System Integration
- Automatic startup option
- Global hotkeys for quick capture
- System notifications for key events

## Technical Stack Recommendations

### Core Technologies
- Python (Primary development language)
- PyQt/PySide6 (GUI framework)
  * Robust support for system tray integration
  * Cross-platform capabilities
  * Rich widget ecosystem
- OpenAI API (Initial LLM integration)

### Data Storage
- JSON file-based storage for history
- Local config file for settings
- Local image storage with reference management

## Conceptual Data Model

### Settings Object
```
{
  "api_keys": {
    "openai": "string",
    "other_providers": "string"
  },
  "history_limit": number,
  "startup_enabled": boolean,
  "hotkeys": {
    "capture_area": "string",
    "capture_window": "string"
  },
  "theme": "light|dark"
}
```

### History Entry Object
```
{
  "timestamp": "datetime",
  "image_path": "string",
  "conversation": [
    {
      "role": "user|assistant",
      "content": "string",
      "timestamp": "datetime"
    }
  ],
  "capture_location": {
    "x": number,
    "y": number,
    "width": number,
    "height": number
  }
}
```

## User Interface Design Principles
- Minimal and non-intrusive
- Context-aware positioning
- Clear visual hierarchy
